        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>250 g rice flour</li>
            <li>500 ml water</li>
            <li>5 g yeast + 20 ml warm water</li>
            <li>110-150 g sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp. several drops of oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix 150ml to 160ml water with rice flour. Combine well.</li>
            <li>In a small pot, melt sugar with the left water (350ml). Bring to boil over medium fire.</li>
            <li>Pour the hot sugar liquid directly to the rice mixture. Combine well and set aside to cool down until less than 40 degree C or room temperature.</li>
            <li>Mix yeast with 20ml and set aside for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine yeast water and rice mixture well, cover with plastic wrapper for proofing.</li>
            <li>Drop several drops of oil in the batter and combine well. Continue proofing until there is a thick layer of small bubbles on the surface.</li>
            <li>Prepare a plate (steel plate is highly recommended as they are usually quite thin) and brush some oil on surface (this can help the de-molding process).</li>
            <li>Bring the water to boil firstly and then pour the rice batter to hot steel plate around 80% full.</li>
            <li>Cover with lid and steam for 15 minutes over high fire. Wait for around 10 minutes after turning off the fire. Transfer the cake out, wait for minutes and move it from the plate. Set aside to cool down completely. Either cut into large wedges or small cubes. Serve cold with tea or as breakfast.</li>
